#Lifejack Exploratory Data Analysis

We surveyed students to define the problem statement and find the specific factors that were
most important to them in finding a city to relocate to upon graduation. The students wanted
to be empowered to make the right decision and the majority of students were concerned
about trade-offs between opportunity and lifestyle factors. We scraped and aggregated various
free datasets to gather the required information, and analyzed it in a number of ways. Our most
interesting findings were:

 Big metro areas are generally high in opportunities, fun and vibrant, and surprisingly low
in crime, but costs are high.
 There are trade-offs between OPPORTUNITY & LIFESTYLE. But there are hidden gems.
